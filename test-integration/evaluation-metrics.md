# Evaluation Metrics for Deebo-Claude Code Integration

This document outlines the evaluation framework for measuring Deebo's effectiveness when integrated with Claude Code for Python scientific computing bug resolution.

## Performance Metrics

### Time-Based Metrics

1. **Time to First Hypothesis (TFH)**
   - Definition: Time from starting debug session to first plausible hypothesis
   - Units: Seconds
   - Collection: Measured from Deebo logs and session pulse
   - Target: < 90 seconds average

2. **Time to Solution (TTS)**
   - Definition: Total time until validated solution is proposed
   - Units: Seconds
   - Collection: Measured from session start to solution delivery
   - Target: 50% faster than Claude Code alone

3. **Hypothesis Generation Rate (HGR)**
   - Definition: Number of distinct hypotheses generated per minute
   - Units: Hypotheses/minute
   - Collection: Count from scenario agent logs
   - Target: > 2 hypotheses/minute

### Quality Metrics

4. **Solution Correctness (SC)**
   - Definition: Binary measure of whether fix resolves the bug
   - Scale: 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct)
   - Collection: Verified by running fixed code
   - Target: > 90% correct

5. **Solution Quality (SQ)**
   - Definition: Assessment of solution's quality beyond correctness
   - Scale: 1-5 (1=minimal fix, 5=optimal solution)
   - Criteria:
     - Robustness to edge cases
     - Code readability
     - Performance impact
     - Generalizability
   - Collection: Expert evaluation
   - Target: Average score > 3.5

6. **Hypothesis Relevance (HR)**
   - Definition: Fraction of hypotheses that are pertinent to the bug
   - Scale: 0-1 (ratio of relevant hypotheses)
   - Collection: Manual assessment of scenario agent reports
   - Target: > 0.7

### Efficiency Metrics

7. **Tool Usage Appropriateness (TUA)**
   - Definition: Assessment of how effectively tools are used
   - Scale: 1-5 (1=poor, 5=excellent)
   - Criteria:
     - Tool selection relevance
     - Parameter specification accuracy
     - Result interpretation
   - Collection: Expert evaluation of logs
   - Target: Average score > 4.0

8. **Resource Utilization (RU)**
   - Definition: System resources used during debugging
   - Units: MB (memory), % (CPU)
   - Collection: System monitoring during execution
   - Target: < 4GB memory, < 50% CPU average

## Comparative Benchmarking

Each test case will be evaluated under three conditions:

1. **Claude Code Only**: Baseline performance of Claude Code without Deebo
2. **Deebo Integration**: Claude Code with Deebo integration
3. **Human Expert**: Reference point from experienced Python developer (where available)

## Data Collection Methodology

1. **Automated Metrics**:
   - Time measurements via timestamps in logs
   - Resource utilization via system monitoring
   - Hypothesis counts from session logs

2. **Manual Assessments**:
   - Solution correctness verification
   - Solution quality evaluation
   - Hypothesis relevance classification

3. **Test Matrix**:
   | Test Repository | Test Condition | Run Count |
   |-----------------|----------------|-----------|
   | numpy-shape-error | Claude Only | 3 |
   | numpy-shape-error | With Deebo | 3 |
   | python-memory-leak | Claude Only | 3 |
   | python-memory-leak | With Deebo | 3 |
   | numeric-stability | Claude Only | 3 |
   | numeric-stability | With Deebo | 3 |
   | pandas-indexing | Claude Only | 3 |
   | pandas-indexing | With Deebo | 3 |

## Results Reporting

Results will be compiled into:

1. **Summary Dashboard**:
   - Key metrics comparison between conditions
   - Statistical significance tests
   - Overall performance improvement measurements

2. **Detailed Performance Report**:
   - Per-test case metrics
   - Resource utilization graphs
   - Qualitative assessments of solutions

3. **Improvement Recommendations**:
   - Configuration optimizations
   - Integration enhancement options
   - Future development priorities
