Installation
Using uv (recommended)
When using uv no specific installation is needed. We will use uvx to directly run mcp-server-git.

Using PIP
Alternatively you can install mcp-server-git via pip:

pip install mcp-server-git
After installation, you can run it as a script using:

python -m mcp_server_git
Configuration
Usage with Claude Desktop
Add this to your claude_desktop_config.json:

Using uvx
Using docker
Using pip installation
Usage with Zed
Add to your Zed settings.json:

Using uvx
Using pip installation
Debugging
You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-git
Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

cd path/to/servers/src/git
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-git
Running tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log will show the logs from the server and may help you debug any issues.

Development
If you are doing local development, there are two ways to test your changes:

Run the MCP inspector to test your changes. See Debugging for run instructions.

Test using the Claude desktop app. Add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json:

Docker
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/Users/username/Desktop,dst=/projects/Desktop",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/path/to/other/allowed/dir,dst=/projects/other/allowed/dir,ro",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/path/to/file.txt,dst=/projects/path/to/file.txt",
        "mcp/git"
      ]
    }
  }
}
UVX
{
"mcpServers": {
  "git": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [ 
      "--directory",
      "/<path to mcp-servers>/mcp-servers/src/git",
      "run",
      "mcp-server-git"
    ]
  }
}
Build
Docker build:

cd src/git
docker build -t mcp/git .

Getting started
Installing uv
Installation methods
Install uv with our standalone installers or your package manager of choice.

Standalone installer
uv provides a standalone installer to download and install uv:


macOS and Linux
Windows
Use curl to download the script and execute it with sh:


curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
If your system doesn't have curl, you can use wget:


wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Request a specific version by including it in the URL:


curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.6.13/install.sh | sh

Tip

The installation script may be inspected before use:


macOS and Linux
Windows

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | less

Alternatively, the installer or binaries can be downloaded directly from GitHub.

See the documentation on installer configuration for details on customizing your uv installation.

PyPI
For convenience, uv is published to PyPI.

If installing from PyPI, we recommend installing uv into an isolated environment, e.g., with pipx:


pipx install uv
However, pip can also be used:


pip install uv
Note

uv ships with prebuilt distributions (wheels) for many platforms; if a wheel is not available for a given platform, uv will be built from source, which requires a Rust toolchain. See the contributing setup guide for details on building uv from source.

Cargo
uv is available via Cargo, but must be built from Git rather than crates.io due to its dependency on unpublished crates.


cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
Homebrew
uv is available in the core Homebrew packages.


brew install uv
WinGet
uv is available via WinGet.


winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
Scoop
uv is available via Scoop.


scoop install main/uv
Docker
uv provides a Docker image at ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv.

See our guide on using uv in Docker for more details.

GitHub Releases
uv release artifacts can be downloaded directly from GitHub Releases.

Each release page includes binaries for all supported platforms as well as instructions for using the standalone installer via github.com instead of astral.sh.

Upgrading uv
When uv is installed via the standalone installer, it can update itself on-demand:


uv self update
Tip

Updating uv will re-run the installer and can modify your shell profiles. To disable this behavior, set INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1.

When another installation method is used, self-updates are disabled. Use the package manager's upgrade method instead. For example, with pip:


pip install --upgrade uv
Shell autocompletion
Tip

You can run echo $SHELL to help you determine your shell.

To enable shell autocompletion for uv commands, run one of the following:


Bash
Zsh
fish
Elvish
PowerShell / pwsh

echo 'eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

To enable shell autocompletion for uvx, run one of the following:


Bash
Zsh
fish
Elvish
PowerShell / pwsh

echo 'eval "$(uvx --generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

Then restart the shell or source the shell config file.

Uninstallation
If you need to remove uv from your system, follow these steps:

Clean up stored data (optional):


uv cache clean
rm -r "$(uv python dir)"
rm -r "$(uv tool dir)"
Tip

Before removing the binaries, you may want to remove any data that uv has stored.

Remove the uv and uvx binaries:


macOS and Linux
Windows

rm ~/.local/bin/uv ~/.local/bin/uvx

Note

Prior to 0.5.0, uv was installed into ~/.cargo/bin. The binaries can be removed from there to uninstall. Upgrading from an older version will not automatically remove the binaries from ~/.cargo/bin.

Next steps
See the first steps or jump straight to the guides to start using uv.

Installation
First, ensure you've downloaded and installed the Claude Desktop app and you have npm installed.

Option 1: Install through npx
Just run this in terminal

npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup
For debugging mode (allows Node.js inspector connection):

npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup --debug
Restart Claude if running

Option 2: Using bash script installer (macOS)
For macOS users, you can use our automated bash installer which will check your Node.js version, install it if needed, and automatically configure Desktop Commander:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
This script handles all dependencies and configuration automatically for a seamless setup experience.

Option 3: Installing via Smithery
To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via Smithery:

npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
Option 4: Add to claude_desktop_config by hand
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json:

On Mac: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
On Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
On Linux: ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Restart Claude if running

Option 5: Checkout locally
Clone and build:
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run setup
Restart Claude if running

The setup command will:

Install dependencies
Build the server
Configure Claude's desktop app
Add MCP servers to Claude's config if needed
Updating Desktop Commander
When installed through npx (Option 1) or Smithery (Option 2), Desktop Commander will automatically update to the latest version whenever you restart Claude. No manual update process is needed.

For manual installations, you can update by running the setup command again.

Usage
The server provides these tool categories:

Terminal Tools
execute_command: Run commands with configurable timeout
read_output: Get output from long-running commands
force_terminate: Stop running command sessions
list_sessions: View active command sessions
list_processes: View system processes
kill_process: Terminate processes by PID
block_command/unblock_command: Manage command blacklist
Filesystem Tools
read_file/write_file: Read files from local filesystem or URLs (supports viewing PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP images directly in Claude)
create_directory/list_directory: Directory management
move_file: Move/rename files
search_files: Pattern-based file search
get_file_info: File metadata
search_code: Recursive ripgrep based text and code search
Edit Tools
edit_block: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes <20% of file size)
write_file: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes >20% or when edit_block fails)
Search/Replace Block Format:

filepath.ext
<<<<<<< SEARCH
content to find
=======
new content
>>>>>>> REPLACE
Example:

src/main.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("old message");
=======
console.log("new message");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
URL Support
read_file can now fetch content from both local files and URLs
Example: read_file with isUrl: true parameter to read from web resources
Handles both text and image content from remote sources
Images (local or from URLs) are displayed visually in Claude's interface, not as text
Claude can see and analyze the actual image content
Default 30-second timeout for URL requests
Handling Long-Running Commands
For commands that may take a while:

execute_command returns after timeout with initial output
Command continues in background
Use read_output with PID to get new output
Use force_terminate to stop if needed
Debugging
If you need to debug the server, you can install it in debug mode:

# Using npx
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup --debug

# Or if installed locally
npm run setup:debug
This will:

Configure Claude to use a separate "desktop-commander" server
Enable Node.js inspector protocol with --inspect-brk=9229 flag
Pause execution at the start until a debugger connects
Enable additional debugging environment variables
To connect a debugger:

In Chrome, visit chrome://inspect and look for the Node.js instance
In VS Code, use the "Attach to Node Process" debug configuration
Other IDEs/tools may have similar "attach" options for Node.js debugging
Important debugging notes:

The server will pause on startup until a debugger connects (due to the --inspect-brk flag)
If you don't see activity during debugging, ensure you're connected to the correct Node.js process
Multiple Node processes may be running; connect to the one on port 9229
The debug server is identified as "desktop-commander-debug" in Claude's MCP server list
Troubleshooting:

If Claude times out while trying to use the debug server, your debugger might not be properly connected
When properly connected, the process will continue execution after hitting the first breakpoint
You can add additional breakpoints in your IDE once connected

Testimonials
It's a life saver! I paid Claude + Cursor currently which I always feel it's kind of duplicated. This solves the problem ultimately. I am so happy. Thanks so much. Plus today Claude has added the web search support. With this MCP + Internet search, it writes the code with the latest updates. It's so good when Cursor doesn't work sometimes or all the fast requests are used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg

This is the first comment I've ever left on a youtube video, THANK YOU! I've been struggling to update an old Flutter app in Cursor from an old pre null-safety version to a current version and implemented null-safety using Claude 3.7. I got most of the way but had critical BLE errors that I spent days trying to resolve with no luck. I tried Augment Code but it didn't get it either. I implemented your MCP in Claude desktop and was able to compare the old and new codebase fully, accounting for the updates in the code, and fix the issues in a couple of hours. A word of advice to people trying this, be sure to stage changes and commit when appropriate to be able to undo unwanted changes. Amazing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&lc=UgztdHvDMqTb9jiqnf54AaABAg

Great! I just used Windsurf, bought license a week ago, for upgrading old fullstack socket project and it works many times good or ok but also many times runs away in cascade and have to revert all changes losing hundereds of cascade tokens. In just a week down to less than 100 tokens and do not want to buy only 300 tokens for 10$. This Claude MCP ,bought claude Pro finally needed but wanted very good reason to also have next to ChatGPT, and now can code as much as I want not worrying about token cost. Also this is much more than code editing it is much more thank you for great video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&lc=UgyQFTmYLJ4VBwIlmql4AaABAg

it is a great tool, thank you, I like using it, as it gives claude an ability to do surgical edits, making it more like a human developer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&lc=Ugy4-exy166_Ma7TH-h4AaABAg

You sir are my hero. You've pretty much summed up and described my experiences of late, much better than I could have. Cursor and Windsurf both had me frustrated to the point where I was almost yelling at my computer screen. Out of whimsy, I thought to myself why not just ask Claude directly, and haven't looked back since. Claude first to keep my sanity in check, then if necessary, engage with other IDEs, frameworks, etc. I thought I was the only one, glad to see I'm not lol. 33 1 https://medium.com/@pharmx/you-sir-are-my-hero-62cff5836a3e

Frequently Asked Questions
Here are answers to some common questions. For a more comprehensive FAQ, see our detailed FAQ document.

What is Claude Desktop Commander?
It's an MCP tool that enables Claude Desktop to access your file system and terminal, turning Claude into a versatile assistant for coding, automation, codebase exploration, and more.

How is this different from Cursor/Windsurf?
Unlike IDE-focused tools, Claude Desktop Commander provides a solution-centric approach that works with your entire OS, not just within a coding environment. Claude reads files in full rather than chunking them, can work across multiple projects simultaneously, and executes changes in one go rather than requiring constant review.

Do I need to pay for API credits?
No. This tool works with Claude Desktop's standard Pro subscription ($20/month), not with API calls, so you won't incur additional costs beyond the subscription fee.

Does Desktop Commander automatically update?
Yes, when installed through npx or Smithery, Desktop Commander automatically updates to the latest version when you restart Claude. No manual update process is needed.

What are the most common use cases?
Exploring and understanding complex codebases
Generating diagrams and documentation
Automating tasks across your system
Working with multiple projects simultaneously
Making surgical code changes with precise control
I'm having trouble installing or using the tool. Where can I get help?
Join our Discord server for community support, check the GitHub issues for known problems, or review the full FAQ for troubleshooting tips. You can also visit our website FAQ section for a more user-friendly experience. If you encounter a new issue, please consider opening a GitHub issue with details about your problem.

Data Collection
During installation and setup, Desktop Commander collects anonymous usage data to help improve the tool. This includes:

Operating system information
Node.js and NPM versions
Installation method and shell environment
Error messages (if any occur during setup)
This data is collected using PostHog analytics and is associated with a machine-generated unique ID. No personal information is collected. This helps us understand how the tool is being used and identify common issues.

We are currently working on adding a built-in opt-out option for this data collection in an upcoming release. For now, if you wish to opt out, you can block network connections to eu.i.posthog.com in your firewall settings.
